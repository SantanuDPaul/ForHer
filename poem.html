				<p>Whenever I see you,
				  <br>it's always like the first time-
				  <br>that day on the corridor, 
				  <br>when the world blurred around you, 
				  <br>and only you shone,
				  <br>bright among the crowd, 
				  <br>different, perfect, effortless.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>And then there was me,
				  <br>an introverted wanderer,
				  <br>circling your orbit,
				  <br>finding purpose in hallways and classrooms,
				  <br>where my only lesson was the hope 
				  <br>of catching a glimpse of you.

		<p>Atleast now I can meet you,
			<br>talk to you,
			<br>even if just for a fleeting moment.
			</p>

			<p>My words may sound foolish, maybe even clich√©,
			<br>And I know times are hard for you
			<br>but I'll wait-
			</p>

			<p>We may not be there yet,
			<br>but something tells me-
			<br>this is worth the wait.
			</p>

			<p>Just know this
			<br>For me,
			<br>You're my first, my Valentine..
